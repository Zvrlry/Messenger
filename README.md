# Messenger
Making an application where people can communicate in real time

In this I use a veriety of things mainly python for everything with a bit of html and a little css basic styling 
I use a sql database to store username and passwords where it also encrypts the password when storing it 
I have a little bit of some javascript where i couldnt figure out how to do something with just python

In the main file app.py I have everything implimented and each route is clear and 
I need to add some more commented portions some code isnt too clear

I used Scoket Io to make chat rooms where users can connect and comunicate in real time
